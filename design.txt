Core
- 2d Platformer
- Two Dimensions overlaying the same space. Both will always exist on the board, yet be transparent depending on your drug usage level.
  - Light world 
      - No enemies, but platforms and walls block your travel
  - Dark world (inverse color scheme)
    - Drug use allows the player to see the dark world
    - Enemies always exist in dark world, but when you phase in they see/interact with you  
- Basic puzzles require player to enter dark world to progress in light world
- Drug object in game needs to be collected and used to enter dark world
 - The more it is used the more the player is "phased" into the dark world

Player
- Using drug has negative effect on light world health
  - Staying in the dark world too long will cause the player to be stuck there

  - Health (your character's health in the light world)
  - Tolerance (your character's health in the dark world)
- WASD move
- Spacebar jump
  - Light world can double jump
  - Dark world single jump
- Left click use health?
- Right click use drug?

Enemies
 - When an enemy hits you, it simply applies more of the drug which keeps you phased longer
 - Floating enemies that just charge straight at you and chase you when you are above a threshold in the darkworld
 - Ranged Enemies that stand still and fire needles
 - Hands pulling downward ( grab and force you to keep clicking until broken free.. Longer you are held the more drug is activated )
